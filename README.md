Hey everyone!

I am on the journey of learning frontend and designs and I make short pages and designs from websites or mockuops for practice.
So I will upload the works that I used for practice and learning in this repository.
You can download and practice yourself if you want or if you just wanna see how it looks like, go ahead and explore.

Every project in the repo  will have 

   • Source code
   • Images used
   • Output Design

Let's start learning!
